        <p class="col-sm-12 history-caption">A new sport from England called football started to take a grip of our country. Its quick uptake meant that in the late nineteenth and early twentieth century the first organisations were created for its practice. One of them was the Madrid Football Club, a predecessor of Real Madrid. Julián Palacios was its first figurehead, but it was Juan Padrós who formally constituted the institution (1902). Interest grew at such a rate that Madrid proposed a tournament in homage to king Alfonso XIII. The initiative became the Copa de España.</p>

        <h3>The Bernabéu Yeste Era (1943–1978)</h3>
        <p>Before becoming president in 1945, Santiago Bernabéu Yeste had already carried out the functions of player, first-team captain, club maintenance, first-team manager and director in an association with the club that would last nearly 70 years. He was responsible for rebuilding the club after the Civil War and under his presidency the construction of the Santiago Bernabéu Stadium and the Ciudad Deportiva.

            Bernabéu also reorganized the club at all levels in what would become the normal operating hierarchy of professional clubs in the future, giving every section and level of the club independent technical teams and recruiting staff, such as Raimundo Saporta. Moreover, under Bernabéu's tutelage, during the 1950s former Real Madrid Amateurs player Miguel Malbo founded Real Madrid's youth academy, or "cantera," known today as La Fábrica.

            Finally, beginning in 1953, Bernabéu embarked upon a strategy of signing world-class players from abroad, the most prominent being the Argentine Alfredo di Stéfano, and built the world's first truly multinational squad. During Bernabéu's presidency, many of Real Madrid's most legendary names played for the club, including Di Stéfano, Ferenc Puskás, Francisco Gento, Héctor Rial, Raymond Kopa, José Santamaría, Miguel Muñoz, Amancio and Santillana.

            It was under Bernabéu's guidance that Real Madrid became established as a major force in both Spanish and European football. Before passing away in 1978, Bernabéu had been the club's president for 33 years, during which Real won one Intercontinental Cup, six European Cups, 16 La Liga titles and six Spanish Cups.</p>
